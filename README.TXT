In this final lab of COE328 Digital Ststesms, using the Altera Quartus II 13.0 FPGA/CPLD development software, a simple general-purpose processor (GPP) was built.
Constructed with VHDL components and block diagram connections, the ALU performes addition, subtraction, and several logical operations. 

Complete details of the functions and features can be seen in the Lab Manual. 
To open the file, open an existing project in Quartus II and select SimpleGPP.qpf in the Lab 6 folder.
