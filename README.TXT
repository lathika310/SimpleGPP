In this final lab for COE328 Digital Systems, a simple general-purpose processor (GPP) was built using the Altera Quartus II (v.13.0) FPGA/CPLD development software.
Constructed VHDL-defined fundamental peices connected in block diagrams, the fully functional ALU performes addition, subtraction, and several logical operations. 

Complete set of objectives and specifications can be found in the Lab manual.
Details of its construction, its feature set and demo calculations can be found in the lab report.
To open the file, open an existing project in Quartus II and select SimpleGPP.qpf in the Lab 6 folder.
