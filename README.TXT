In this final lab for COE328 Digital Systems, a simple general-purpose processor (GPP) was built using the Altera Quartus II (v.13.0) FPGA/CPLD development software.
Constructed VHDL-defined fundamental peices connected in block diagrams, the fully functional ALU performes addition, subtraction, and several logical operations. 

Complete details of the functions and features can be seen in the Lab Manual. 
To open the file, open an existing project in Quartus II and select SimpleGPP.qpf in the Lab 6 folder.
